# Our Services

At Talk2Nebiah, we offer a range of services designed to provide practical support and guidance on your mental wellness journey.

### One-on-One Peer Support

Connect with a trained peer support listener who can offer a compassionate ear and share their own experiences. These are not therapy sessions, but confidential conversations aimed at providing comfort and perspective.

### Group Support Sessions

Join our themed group discussions on topics like managing anxiety, coping with burnout, and navigating life transitions. Share and learn from others who are on a similar path.

### Workshops & Resources

We offer workshops and a library of resources on topics such as mindfulness, stress-reduction techniques, and building healthy habits. Our goal is to empower you with practical tools to support your mental well-being.

*Please note: Our services are designed for peer support and are not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. If you are in crisis, please contact a mental health professional or a crisis hotline.*
