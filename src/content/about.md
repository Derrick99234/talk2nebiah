# About Talk2Nebiah

Talk2Nebiah was founded on a simple but powerful belief: no one should have to suffer in silence. Mental health is a universal human experience, affecting everyone from children to adults. The quiet battles people fight every day are real, and they deserve to be heard.

Our mission is to break the stigma surrounding mental health by creating a space for honest, judgment-free conversations. We are not about clinical diagnoses or prescriptions. We are about shared human experiences, practical coping mechanisms, and the power of community.

We believe that through talking, healing, unlearning, and growing, we can find hope and strength together. This is a space to breathe again, think clearly, and rediscover your inner resilience.
